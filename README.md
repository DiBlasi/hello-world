Hello World exercise to learn basics of Github
This is an edit to my original Github hello-world exercise
I am a Junior IMM major from Jackson New Jersey.  I have a twin brother that also goes to TCNJ, so if you see me on campus it might not be me.  I like playing soccer, hanging out with my fraternity and chilling with friends.  Programming and coding is a scary topic to me becasue it is something that gives me trouble, however I am excited for this class!
above I made cahges to the original file by adding information about myself.
